# Data-Science-Nigeria-2018-Notebooks-and-practice
This repo houses my notebooks on Exploratory data analysis as well as feature engineering and Modelling of a 
Supermarket dataset to predict sales. the dataset provided by the Data science Nigeria body for the intercampus machine learning
competition, july to september 2018.


i didnt own a laptop the the whole of 2018, i took the compulsory qualifying edX courses borrowing people's laptops. When the main 
intercampus machine learning competition came. i was so stranded plus it clashed with my exams. it then became so difficult 
because i didn't own a laptop. i didnt give up though. i managed to do the little i could. i ended up at 109th position out of 140 participants
i couldn't do much. i was also protecting my First class cgpa which i am grateful i had. 

Few days after my uncle sent me this laptop all the way from germany in January of 2019, i searched for the supermarket datasets again, 
because i wasnt satisfied with what i did earlier at the intercampus ML competition and played with it again to my satisfaction. this time 
without the fear of the owner of the laptop coming to tell me he/she needs it back as it had always happened whilst i was preparing for 
the competition. 

which is why i created this repo. to store this memory. One thing for sure, I never let the fire die.. even when i didnt have the resouces
and the odds were'nt in my favour. i really cried hard and was so heartbroken when i discovered i wasn't going to make it to the 2018
bootcamp. because i didn't own a laptop to compete with other fellow competitors. thank God for my family that consoled me and told me to 
channel that pain and hurt to making myself some1 that would matter in the AI domain someday. 

something i expect you to note from this little experience is this. SHIT DON'T LAST!  No matter you're passing through. just keep 
holding on there, it would surely get better. 

i forgot to add, i am still in my 400 level as at the time of creating this though. But i recently just signed a contract with Retina-AI Health Inc.
a US based company that uses AI for Retinal care, as a Data scientist / Programmer. 

The funny part is that i study Urban and Regional Planning. nothing relate to computer science or Engineering. *Anything is possible only 
if u are willing to make it.* 

I plan to pursue a career in Machine Learning with keen interests in Computer vision and Natural Language Processing. I would definitely 
look for ways to propagate it back to solving urban planning problems. looking at Transportation and Climate change. 


Tribute to this memory, when i look back at it sometime in the nearest future.
